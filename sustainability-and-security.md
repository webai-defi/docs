# Sustainability and security

## üîê **Enterprise-Grade Security Architecture**

Web AI implements a defense-in-depth security framework that protects both the platform and user assets through multiple layers of redundancy and advanced cryptographic protocols.

> _"Security isn't a feature‚Äîit's the foundation upon which our entire infrastructure is built. Every transaction, every data point, and every agent interaction is secured with military-grade encryption and real-time threat analysis."_

## üå©Ô∏è **Distributed Cloud Infrastructure**

Our platform operates on a globally distributed, auto-scaling cloud infrastructure designed for maximum resilience and continuous operation.

## üöÄ **Infrastructure Specifications**

| **Component**          | **Specifications**                                    | **Redundancy Level**                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Compute Layer          | Kubernetes clusters with auto-scaling nodes           | N+3 redundancy across 5 global regions |
| Database Layer         | Distributed NoSQL clusters with real-time replication | Hexagonal multi-master architecture    |
| Network Infrastructure | 100 Gbps backbone with sub-5ms global latency         | Multi-provider mesh topology           |
| Power Systems          | Green energy primary with conventional backup         | 99.9999% availability guarantee        |
| Monitoring System      | AI-powered anomaly detection with predictive alerts   | 24/7/365 NOC with human oversight      |

## üîÑ **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery**

Web AI maintains a comprehensive BCDR protocol ensuring continuous operation even during severe disruptions:

* **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 1 second data loss in catastrophic scenario
* **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 30 seconds for full system restoration
* **Geographical Redundancy**: Active-active deployments across 5 continental zones
* **Data Preservation**: Immutable blockchain-verified backups with cryptographic integrity validation
* **Black Start Capability**: Autonomous system restoration without external dependencies
