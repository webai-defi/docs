### 🧠 Self-Learning Strategy Optimization  
```python  
async def optimize_strategy(params):  
    """Genetic algorithm for real-time strategy evolution"""  
    population = initialize_population(params)  
    for _ in range(GENERATIONS):  
        fitness_scores = [backtest_strategy(individual) for individual in population]  
        parents = select_top_performers(population, fitness_scores)  
        offspring = crossover(parents) + mutate(parents)  
        population = parents + offspring  
    return elite_individual(population)  

# Sample output:
