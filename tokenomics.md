## 🔥 **Deflationary Mechanisms & Value Accrual**

The $WAI token incorporates multiple value-accrual mechanisms to ensure continuous price appreciation and ecosystem sustainability:

| **Mechanism** | **Implementation** | **Economic Impact** |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Transaction Fee Burn | 1.5% of all transactions | Continuous supply reduction |
| Protocol Revenue Buyback | 40% of platform fees | Market price support |
| Staking Rewards | 5-15% APY with time-locks | Supply velocity reduction |
| Governance Staking | Quadratic voting power | Long-term holder alignment |
| Dynamic Supply Adjustment | Algorithm-driven buybacks | Counter-cyclical stability |

## 🏦 **Decentralized Treasury Management**

The Web AI DAO treasury is governed by a sophisticated multi-signature framework with time-locked execution:
